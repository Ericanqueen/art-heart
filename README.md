# art-heart My journey has been an adventure! I 
bet yours has too! Everyone has quite a story to
tell I'm sure. Life is something else! What I can 
tell you about mine is that I've always strived to
accomplish my version of a quality life. For me
that means purpose, family, happiness, and love. And 
last but not least, God. God has been my co-pilot
on this adventure. That's me in a nutshell.
